# Glossia

To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

## Worktree-aware databases

Development and test database names are derived at runtime from the current working tree path.
No `.codex` setup is required: each Git worktree gets isolated Postgres and ClickHouse databases automatically.

Set `GLOSSIA_DB_SUFFIX` only if you need to override the automatic suffix.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
